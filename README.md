## Running Integration Tests

At the top in Unity click `Unity Test Tools` in between `Component` and `Window`. Then click `Integration Test Runner` to 
open the new window for integration tests. Navigate to a test scene in `Tests/**/*.unity`. Press `Run All` to run all 
the tests. The tests will be ran in the scene and results outputed to the console and test runner.
